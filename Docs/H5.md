Write ipynb file to read h5 file

the virtual env has to be switched in advance to enable the package for reading h5, here are the steps of switching venv for jupyter notebook

1. Activate the virtual environment you want to use in your terminal. For example, if you are using Anaconda, you can activate your environment by running:

   ```
   conda activate myenv
   ```

2. Install the `ipykernel` package inside your virtual environment. This package provides the IPython kernel for Jupyter, which allows you to run code in the notebook using your virtual environment.

   ```
   pip install ipykernel
   ```

3. Next, you need to create a new kernel for your virtual environment. You can do this by running:

   ```
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv
   ```

   This will create a new kernel in Jupyter with the name `myenv`.

4. Now you can launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser.

5. In Jupyter Notebook, you can switch to your virtual environment by selecting the kernel from the Kernel menu. To do this, go to the Kernel menu and select "Change kernel", then choose the kernel with the name of your virtual environment.
