## Questions Regarding the LoopX

1. Is the connection between the navigation system and the teaching pendant fixed?
2. Is it possible to write some script on the windows environment of the Loop-X?
3. Can we directly save our file to the local driver and get access to it from the local environment?
4. Can the teaching pendant set up a public network, i.e. WAN, except for the local network?
5. Can the navigation system be customized? For example, adding some script.



### Possible Solutions

1. Script on Teaching Pendant
2. ssh to the teaching pendant
3. Script on the Navigation Platform and use a wireless stick to set up a private WAN
4. SanDisk Wireless Stick, need an app on my computer



### [Update Comments] Feb 09, 2023

Print out a paper form handout for the Slides. Add Group Number

Deliverables matter! Don't be vague. [**Documentation**/Program/Design]

<u>Specification Review, Task Plan Review, Test Plan Documentation</u>

Milestones

Dependency: Need, Status, Followup, ContingencyPlan, Include Dates

Dependency includes software access, hardware access, other people, money

Timeline before 5.11



### [Update Log]

What exactly are we going to document? SyntheX .....





### [Weekly Meeting Feb 13th, 2023]

**What's the specific workflow?** - LoopX ->  SyntheX -> Registration Grupp 

**Solutions to the data acquisition.**

1. SanDisk Wireless Stick, need an app on my computer

2. PACS

What role does SyntheX play in this whole process? - Preparing dataset for other models?



Tasks TODO:

Make a Slides to Ben before the presentation

Make documentation and explain the whole pipeline for SnytheX.

Integrate SytheX in a docker image

IRB is not a dependency.

Find landmarks with SyntheX-made X-Ray
